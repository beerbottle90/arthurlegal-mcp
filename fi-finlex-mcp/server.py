INSTRUCTIONS = """Finnish legislation from Finlex, the Ministry of Justice's
open-data service. Akoma Ntoso XML, no auth.

TWO CORPORA, NOT ONE.
- `statute-consolidated` — the amended text. This is "the law" for most questions.
- `statute` — the act AS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED, amendments not applied.
Every response says which one it came from. Do not mix them.

TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES. Finnish (`fin@`) and Swedish (`swe@`) texts are equally
authoritative and both are indexed. A search may return either; the `lang` field
says which. That is correct behaviour, not a bug.

NEVER BUILD AN IDENTIFIER. A `lang_version` like `fin@20221099` carries a
version stamp. For the current consolidated text pass just `fin@` or `swe@`
(or nothing): the server asks Finlex for the latest version and reports the
stamp it got in `lang_version`. A specific stamp comes from `browse_year` or
`recent_changes`; an invented one is rejected, not guessed at.

SEARCH IS LOCAL. Finlex has no full-text search endpoint, so `search_acts` runs
against a local index. Read `index_coverage` before concluding an act does not
exist — the index holds only the years that were crawled.

MEANING-ONLY MATCHES. When no word of the query occurs in the index, results
carry `match: "semantic only"` and the response a `warning`: they are leads,
not answers, and the act asked about may be outside the index. Results no more
similar than unrelated text are dropped (`semantic_filter`)."""
