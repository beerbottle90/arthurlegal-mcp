ArthurLegalTR stands on work by others. What was taken, from where, and what
was done with it:

## Said Sürücü — `saidsurucu/yargi-mcp`, `saidsurucu/mevzuat-mcp` (MIT)

The upstream *knowledge* in this server — which endpoint each Turkish court
and regulator actually answers on, what headers Bedesten expects, the 79
chamber codes, the GİB özelge body shape, the
Sigorta Tahkim journal file-name rules, the AYM Kararlar Bilgi Bankası
envelope — was established in those two repositories and is reused here.

What is *not* reused: the FastMCP/httpx/pydantic/markitdown stack, the OAuth
and billing layers, and the paid search keys (Brave for KVKK, Tavily for BDDK
and Sigorta Tahkim, OpenRouter for embeddings). Every adapter in `sources/`
is a fresh standard-library implementation; where it follows the reference
closely the module docstring says so.

The MIT licence text of both projects is reproduced below as required.

Related projects by the same author that were surveyed but not reused:
`ihale-mcp` (EKAP tenders — out of scope), `markapatent-mcp` (TÜRKPATENT via
a paid CAPTCHA solver — deliberately not reproduced), `yargi-cli`,
`mevzuat-cli`, `yargi-pro-gemma-local` (a local-LLM launcher, not a data
source).

## `beerbottle90/arthurlegal-mcp`, including its `nl-rechtspraak-mcp/` folder (MIT)

`mcpcore.py` (dependency-free MCP JSON-RPC server, stdio + Streamable HTTP) and
`retrieval.py` (SQLite FTS5 + trigram + vector hybrid retrieval with RRF) are
vendored from the ArthurLegal jurisdiction servers. `retrieval.py` gained one
Turkish-specific change here: dotless-ı query expansion (`_dotless_variants`).
