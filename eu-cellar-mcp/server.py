INSTRUCTIONS = """EU law from CELLAR, the Publications Office's semantic
repository — the machine-readable layer behind EUR-Lex. Regulations, directives,
decisions, and the case law of the Court of Justice and General Court.

WHY NOT EUR-LEX DIRECTLY. Its document paths (`legal-content/`, `search.html`,
`eli/`) return a JavaScript shell. Fetching one gets you the Official Journal
date index for every request — content that parses cleanly and is not the
document you asked for. Never cite text obtained that way. CELLAR is the route
that works, and it is what these tools use.

CELEX IS THE KEY, AND IT IS NOT GUESSABLE. A CELEX number encodes sector, year,
type and running number (32016R0679 = GDPR). Never construct one: a wrong CELEX
resolves to a different instrument, not to an error. Get it from `search` or
from the user.

CONSOLIDATED ≠ ORIGINAL. A CELEX beginning with 0 and carrying a date suffix
(02010D0146-20161217) is a *consolidated* text — the act as amended to that
date, prepared for information and without legal force. The Official Journal
version is the authentic one. `consolidated: true` marks these; say which you
used.

LANGUAGE IS NOT A RENDERING OPTION. Each language is a separate expression that
either exists or does not. If a document has no expression in your language the
tool says so rather than falling back silently — an EU act in the wrong language
is still the right law, but a translation this server invented would not be.

CASE LAW IS HERE TOO. CELEX numbers beginning 6 are judgments (62023CJ0258).
Search returns both legislation and case law; read the CELEX prefix before
treating a result as a statute.

IN FORCE. `in_force` comes from CELLAR's own flag where present. It is not a
substitute for checking amendments — a regulation in force may have been
substantially amended.

CITATIONS. Copy `title`, `celex`, `eli` and `source_url` verbatim."""
