INSTRUCTIONS = """Polish legislation from the Sejm's ELI API — Dziennik Ustaw
(Journal of Laws) and Monitor Polski.

STATUS IS PART OF THE CITATION. Every act carries `in_force` — the API's own
`inForce` flag (`IN_FORCE` / `NOT_IN_FORCE`) — and `status`, the publisher's
label. The label is often about consolidation, not validity: the Civil Code is
`akt posiada tekst jednolity` ("has a consolidated text") and in force. Read
`in_force` for validity and report both. `in_force: null` means the API did not
say; the response then carries `in_force_warning` — do not guess. Citing a
Polish act without its status is an incomplete citation, the same discipline the
Azerbaijani e-qanun source follows.

AMENDMENTS. `get_act` returns a `references` graph with the publisher's own
relation names — `Akty zmieniające` (amending acts), `Akty uchylone` (repealed
acts), `Akty wykonawcze` (implementing acts), `Inf. o tekście jednolitym`
(consolidated-text notices). Each relation is cut to `references_limit` entries;
`references_total` gives the full counts. An act can be in force and still have
been amended many times; check the graph before treating a text as current.

TWO SEARCHES, DIFFERENT REACH.
- `search_by_title` hits the live API but matches TITLES ONLY. Acts the title
  names come first, in force before repealed (`title_match: exact title` is
  the act bearing the name), then amending acts and notices, newest first.
- `search_indexed` hits the local index and covers titles plus the Sejm's own
  subject keywords — use it for "which act governs X".
Neither searches article text: most acts are PDF-only (`textHTML: false`), so
there is no HTML body to index. For article-level work, open the act's PDF.

CITATIONS. Copy `display_address` (e.g. `Dz.U. 2024 poz. 1984`) and `citation`
verbatim. Never construct a Dz.U. number."""
